## Email Body

Hi [First Name],

Just back from Melbourne after co-facilitating an EventStorming workshop with Andrea Magnorsky and speaking at ADAConf 2025.

The week confirmed something I've observed over 15 years of teaching: collaborative modeling creates insights no individual working alone can achieve. Watching participants discover hidden domain events, identify bottlenecks, and uncover bounded contexts reminded me why this work matters.

**Two highlights:**

**Thursday workshop**: Full day with Andrea covering Big Picture, Process Modeling, and Software Design EventStorming. Participants moved from uncertainty to confidence as they practiced modeling their domains.

**Friday at ADAConf**: Hands-on session connecting domain modeling using EventStorming with baking design concepts deeply into code. One participant called it "a masterclass in demonstrating the immense power of integrating domain concepts into code." The Australian DDD community's energy and curiosity made teaching a joy.

**Quick lessons from the trip:**
- Collaboration beats individual brilliance
- Visualization creates shared understanding
- Practice builds confidence through participation
- Communities matter more than ever

**For those in APAC**: I'm running an EventStorming Facilitation Virtual Workshop **December 2-5**, specifically scheduled for APAC timezones. Same participatory, camera-on format that has worked well in past virtual workshops. Covers Big Picture, Process Modeling, and Software Design techniques for feature discovery, design, and architecture decisions. Small cohorts, direct feedback. No prior EventStorming experience needed.

I've written up the full experience with timelapse videos and workshop photos on the blog:

Special thanks to the ADAConf organizers—Chris Simon, Sonal Premi, and Alicia Cheah—for creating such a welcoming venue for the community.

Thanks for being part of this community. If you're working on interesting domain modeling challenges, I'd love to hear about them—just hit reply.

**Mailchimp Implementation Notes:**

1. **Hero Image**: Use `src/assets/adaconf-2025-workshop.jpg` (220KB, web-optimized)
   - Upload to Mailchimp content studio
   - Place after opening paragraph

2. **CTA Buttons**:
   - Primary: "Register for APAC Workshop" → https://ti.to/EDDD/eventstorming-facilitation-virtual-workshop-dec-2025
   - Secondary: "Read Full Story" → https://virtualgenius.com/blog/adaconf-2025-melbourne-workshop-and-speaking

3. **Design**:
   - Single-column layout
   - Image: Full-width hero after opening
   - Font: System default (readable on all devices)
   - CTA styling: Red button matching brand (#C8342C)

4. **Segment Recommendations**:
   - Send to: All subscribers
   - Consider separate send to APAC subscribers with emphasized workshop dates
   - A/B test subject lines 1 vs 2 with 10% sample

5. **Timing**:
   - Send Tuesday-Thursday 9-11am subscriber local time
   - Best engagement: Tuesday 10am

6. **Video/Photo Consideration**:
   - Mailchimp doesn't support embedded video well
   - Use hero image (`src/assets/adaconf-2025-workshop.jpg`) with "See workshop videos & photos →" CTA to blog
   - Alternative: Use one of the 18 workshop photos from `/public/images/adaconf-2025/` for variety
   - Advanced: Create animated GIF from timelapse frames (keep under 1MB)
