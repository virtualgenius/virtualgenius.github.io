# LinkedIn Post: ADAConf 2025

Just back from Melbourne after an incredible week teaching EventStorming and speaking at ADAConf 2025!

**Thursday**: Co-facilitated a full-day EventStorming workshop with Andrea Magnorsky (https://www.linkedin.com/in/magnorsky). The energy in the room as participants discovered hidden domain events, identified process bottlenecks, and uncovered bounded contexts reminded me why I love this work.

**Friday**: Hands-on session at ADAConf focused on connecting domain modeling using EventStorming with baking design concepts deeply into code. The conference theme—"(Architectural) Change"—perfectly aligned with EventStorming's strength in helping teams understand and respond to organizational change.

The response was encouraging—one participant called it "a masterclass in demonstrating the immense power of integrating domain concepts into code, drastically improving readability, maintainability, and testability."

Some observations from the week:

**Collaboration beats individual brilliance.** The best insights came from diverse perspectives working together, not from any single expert in the room.

**Visualization creates shared understanding.** Putting domain events on a timeline made complexity tangible and discussable for everyone.

**Practice builds confidence.** Participants who were hesitant at first became confident participants by the end of the workshop.

The Australian DDD community is vibrant, curious, and deeply committed to building software that's valuable for users, pleasant for builders, and collaborative in design. ADAConf exemplifies this perfectly.

**For APAC folks:** I'm running an EventStorming Facilitation Virtual Workshop December 2-5, specifically scheduled for APAC timezones. Same camera-on, participatory format that has worked well in past virtual workshops. 12 hours over 4 sessions, covering Big Picture, Process Modeling, and Software Design techniques for feature discovery, design, and architecture decisions.

Thanks to everyone who attended, asked great questions, and made my first Australian teaching experience memorable. Special thanks to the conference organizers—Chris Simon, Sonal Premi, and Alicia Cheah—for creating such a welcoming venue. Already looking forward to returning!
