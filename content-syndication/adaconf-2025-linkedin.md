# LinkedIn Post: ADAConf 2025

## Paul's LinkedIn Posting Style Guidelines

**Core Philosophy:**
- LinkedIn posts are **teasers that drive traffic to blog posts**
- Target length: 200-300 words (not 400+)
- Link to full blog post **early** (first paragraph)
- The blog post is where the complete story lives

**Tone & Structure:**
- Personal and conversational, not formal or corporate
- Lead with emotion/impact ("incredible time"), not logistics
- Use natural flow, not rigid structure (no bold day labels, numbered lists, or "key observations")
- Integrate insights naturally into narrative rather than extracting as bullet points
- Keep it **concise** - blog post has the full details

**Content Approach:**
- Focus on people and gratitude - name individuals and thank them specifically
- Keep testimonials brief and integrated (not standalone blockquotes)
- Blend workshop details into the story, don't separate them
- Use simple paragraph breaks, not formatted section headers
- **Tease, don't tell everything** - leave readers wanting more (that's what the blog link is for)

**Call-to-Action:**
- Link to blog post **in first paragraph** for full story
- Put promotional content (workshops) at the END, after all gratitude and narrative
- Keep promotional content brief and natural, not a sales pitch

**What to Avoid:**
- Long posts (400+ words) - that's what the blog is for
- Bullet point "key observations" or lessons learned
- Bold formatting for structure (days, sections)
- Extracting quotes as standalone elements
- Corporate/formal language patterns
- Leading with schedule/logistics
- Making the post compete with the blog post - they work together

**Example Pattern:**
1. Emotional hook + link to full blog post (first paragraph)
2. Brief personal narrative with integrated details (2-3 paragraphs)
3. Specific gratitude to individuals
4. Promotional content if relevant (workshops, etc.)
5. Keep total length: 200-300 words

## ACTUAL POST (Published 2025-01-19)

I had an incredible time teaching EventStorming and speaking at Analysis, Design & Architecture last week! Full write-up with timelapse videos and workshop photos: https://lnkd.in/gVi5YuaC

Last Thursday I co-taught a full-day EventStorming workshop with Andrea Magnorsky. Watching participants discover hidden domain events, identify bottlenecks, and uncover bounded contexts - moving from uncertainty to confidence - reminded me why I love this work.

Friday was ADAConf, with a 2-hour hands-on session connecting EventStorming with baking design concepts deeply into code. Thanks very much to Maryam Yasaei and Sruthi Nair for their kind words about the session.

Thanks to everyone who attended the EventStorming workshop and my hands-on session, and especially to Andrea for co-teaching the workshop. My favorite talks were the opening and closing ones by Linda McIver and Diana Montalion.

Special thanks to organizers Chris Simon, Sonal Premi, and Alicia Cheah for creating such a welcoming venue. Already looking forward to returning!

For APAC folks: I'm running an EventStorming Facilitation Virtual Workshop December 2-5, specifically scheduled for APAC timezones, covering Big Picture, Process Modeling, and Software Design techniques. More info at https://lnkd.in/g_H9XJt6

## DRAFT VERSION (Not Published)

Just back from Melbourne after an incredible week teaching EventStorming and speaking at ADAConf 2025!

**Thursday**: Co-facilitated a full-day EventStorming workshop with Andrea Magnorsky (https://www.linkedin.com/in/magnorsky). Watching participants discover hidden domain events, identify bottlenecks, and uncover bounded contexts—moving from uncertainty to confidence—reminded me why I love this work.

**Friday**: 2-hour hands-on session at ADAConf on connecting EventStorming with baking design concepts deeply into code. One participant called it "a masterclass in demonstrating the immense power of integrating domain concepts into code, drastically improving readability, maintainability, and testability."

Key observations:

**Collaboration beats individual brilliance.** The best insights came from diverse perspectives working together.

**Visualization creates shared understanding.** Putting domain events on a timeline made complexity tangible and discussable.

**An incremental approach builds confidence.** Introducing one concept at a time kept participants engaged throughout.

**For APAC folks:** I'm running an EventStorming Facilitation Virtual Workshop December 2-5, specifically scheduled for APAC timezones. 12 hours over 4 sessions, covering Big Picture, Process Modeling, and Software Design techniques.

Thanks to everyone who attended, and to Andrea for co-teaching. I especially enjoyed the talks by Linda McIver and Diana Montalion. Special thanks to organizers Chris Simon, Sonal Premi, and Alicia Cheah for creating such a welcoming venue. Already looking forward to returning!

**Media options for LinkedIn:**
1. Single video: Use `/public/videos/adaconf-2025-workshop-timelapse.mp4` (main workshop timelapse - 26 seconds)
2. Image carousel: Use any selection from `/public/images/adaconf-2025/` (15 photos available)
3. Multiple videos: Post workshop timelapse in main post, other timelapses (`workshop-timelapse-4.mp4`, `adaconf-2025-collaboration.mp4`, `adaconf-2025-hands-on.mp4`) in comments

**Recommended**: Use main workshop timelapse video for maximum engagement, or create a 4-image carousel from the 15 workshop photos showing progression.
