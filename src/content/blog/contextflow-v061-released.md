ContextFlow v0.6.1 has been released with several exciting improvements to help you visualize and design your software architecture using Domain-Driven Design and Wardley Mapping techniques.

## What's New

**Corrected Wardley Map Hierarchy**

The Actor→User Need→Bounded Context hierarchy has been corrected to properly reflect Wardley Map principles, making your strategic visualizations more accurate and meaningful.

**Enhanced Positioning Controls**

You can now drag User Needs horizontally along the evolution axis, giving you more precise control over where your needs sit on the evolution spectrum from Genesis to Commodity.

**Connection Improvements**

- **Actor→Need Connections**: Visually link actors to their user needs for clearer stakeholder mapping
- **Need→Context Connections**: Connect user needs to bounded contexts to show how your architecture serves user needs

**Empty Project Template**

Start fresh with an empty project template, perfect for beginning your next strategic design session from scratch.

**Blob-Style Groups**

Groups now display as smooth, organic shapes ("Blobs") that elegantly encapsulate your bounded contexts, making your diagrams more visually appealing and easier to understand.
